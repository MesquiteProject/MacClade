Everything displays as one line with small rectangles representing the end of lines.- Ian Frame}{Also, if the new shaded matrix styles are choosen, and then changed to some other style, the dimed lower cases persist. Choosing e.g. "plain molecular" after a shaded will keep the shaded option which must be clicked off under "color cells".
