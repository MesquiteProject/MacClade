Why don't  we add two}{	simple features (1) option to highlight footnoted cells by color instead of * and bold, and (2) a footnote-fill command}{	that allows a block of cells to be selected and all given the same footnote.  This would make it easy to mark all tentative}{	cells with a color and a footnote "tentative", for instance.  Also Remove All Feet was a confusing name to me, since}{	I expected it would clean out the matrix entirely.

Advantage of this system is that it helps us avoid}{	Color Cells as an option-menu item}{  Fill Footnotes	(operates like Fill... on selected block, dialog box with footnote to put in all selected cells; w/keyboard equiv)}{v4: Search and replace should allow plain search and goto eventually.}{	This came up because Michael wanted to find if a data file had any stop codons, so we converted}{	it to protein and tried to figure out how to find *'s.  The only way we thought of was to define a stepmatrix that}{	had infinities as entries for changes to and from * and look to see if we got any error messages in the tree count!}{	We thought we could Search and Replace * by * and see a report, but first MacClade won't let you replace * by * and}{	second there was no report.  I'll let you decide if and how you provide anything to do this stuff.  In the future of course}{	we can have oodles of information scanners on the matrix -- select a block, and ask for state frequencies over}{	block selected; or count the number of matches with the first taxon, or }{	search for any entry in cell or string of entries (e.g. in nucleotide data, looking for TATA, stop codons, etc.)}{v4: option to delete [100] etc. from end of sequence data}{v4: have new sort of consensus sequence that just lists ambiguity codes}{v4: in editor, selecting block via shift-click always uses upper left as home, rather than first cell touched.

These allow states too high for character types slip through.  It would}{	be nice to fix this, but not absolutley necessary.  The first three}{	will rarely cause problems since character types applying to less than 4 states will rarely be used with nucleotide data;}{	Multiply mostly causes problems if you don't ask to copy character types and the default type is user-defined.}{	And even if illegal states are allowed, the problem seems to be pretty effectively corrected on entry to the tree window.}{edit v4: select all context dependent in editor, so that will select all char names if current selcell in char names...}{edit v3.1 or v4: because state names are conserved cell by cell during}	{recoding, they offer a special opportunity to recode underlying data and}	{ordering of states while keeping appearances the same.
