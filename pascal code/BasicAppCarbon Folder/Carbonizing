     BasicCarbonApp is the unaltered application just as I coded it     in MetroWerks. It should run under MacOSX in compatibility mode.     CarbonApp(m) was altered using ResEdit to include a 'carb' re-     source which the Carbon SDK Read Me says should be included to     have the app run in 'native' mode. I haven't had the chance to     confirm any of this. Machines are at a premium at the moment,     so I'll have to round up a G3 somewhere. I suspect that Metro-     werks has some more work to do and I'm not aware, yet, of a com-     piler that will work under MacOS X itself. If you have a MacOS     X server around, I'd appreciate you trying to run both of these.     Or, send the app to someone who does.Do you have the Carbon SDK? You'll need that to reproduce my results.Let me know if you don't.If you have it, here's how I put together the Pascal framework:1) Copy the CARBON SUPPORT folder of the INTO METROWERKS folder into   INTO METROWERKS on your development platform.2) Copy the CARBON PROJECT folder of the INTO METROWERKS folder into   INTO METROWERKS on your development platform.3) On your development platform, duplicate the CARBON PROJECT station-   ery and rename in CARBON PASCAL PROJECT4) Launch BASICAPP.MCP project file within CARBON PASCAL PROJECT5) In the PREFERENCES menu, change the access path pointing to the C   headers so that it points to the Pascal interfaces.6) Add the following line to the UPI.PREFIX file and make sure the new   project points to it:          { $SETC TARGET_API_MAC_CARBON TRUE }7) Change the PPC LINKER main parameter from __main to __start8) Open a NEW document and place the code that follows into it. Save it   as BasicApp.P and remove BasicApp.c9) Try compiling it.
