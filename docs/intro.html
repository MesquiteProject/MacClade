Maddison and Wayne P. Maddison</P>              <hr>              <P>MacClade is used as a tool for phylogenetic analysis. But by                 its nature it also embodies a world view, a portrayal of a phylogenetic                 approach to studying diversity and evolution. It is relatively                 easy to see the diversity of living organisms, but it has proved                 more difficult to see that diversity in terms of its history;                 the slow development of a thoroughly phylogenetic perspective                 in biology attests to this challenge. Together the MacClade manual                 and program present methods for analyzing and exploring phylogenetic                 hypotheses, including hypotheses about character evolution. MacClade                 is one attempt to give our mind's eye phylogenetic lenses, to                 help us think about and see lineages and evolution.</P>              <P>The MacClade CD comes with versions of the program MacClade for                 both MacOS X and earlier versions of the MacOS (7.5 through 9.2.2).                 The CD also contains a complete, 502-page manual in PDF format                 (with linked movies and examples). </P>              <P>MacClade provides an interactive environment for exploring phylogeny.                 In MacClade's tree window, hypothesized phylogenetic trees or                 cladograms can be manipulated and character evolution visualized                 upon them. To manipulate the tree, tools are provided to move                 branches, reroot clades, create polytomies, and search automatically                 for more parsimonious trees. Character evolution is reconstructed                 on the tree and indicated by "painting" the branches. Alternative                 reconstructions of character evolution can be explored. Summaries                 of changes in all characters can be depicted on the tree. As trees                 are manipulated, MacClade updates statistics such as treelength                 and the results are depicted in graphics and charts.</P>              <CENTER>                <IMG SRC="mc4picts/treewindow.gif" WIDTH=351 HEIGHT=316 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom><BR>                Examining character evolution on a tree in MacClade's tree window              </CENTER>              <P>MacClade provides charts summarizing various aspects of character                 evolution on one or more trees, as well as charts comparing two                 or more trees. For example, the charts can show the number of                 trees of each length, the number of characters on the tree with                 different consistency indices, and so on. There are charts specifically                 designed for DNA/RNA sequence data, including one showing the                 number of changes on the tree at first, second, and third codon                 positions, and a chart of the relative frequencies of various                 transitions and transversions.</P>              <CENTER>                <IMG SRC="mc4picts/chart.gif" WIDTH=226 HEIGHT=222 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom><BR>                A chart showing the relative frequencies of reconstructed changes                 between bases on a tree,<BR>                with area of circle proportional to frequency of change              </CENTER>              <P>In MacClade's data editor, systematic and comparative data are                 entered and edited.

We envisage MacClade's                 use by biologists of many backgrounds. For example, suppose:</P>              <OL>                <LI>A systematist is working on the phylogenetic relationships                   of snail species. She enters data for 100 morphological characters                   and 20 taxa in MacClade's data editor, saves the file, and reads                   it into Swofford's (2000) PAUP*. PAUP* is used to find parsimonious                   trees, but to her surprise, the resulting trees separate two                   species she had thought closely related. By moving back to MacClade,                   examining alternative trees by hand, and using the charting                   functions, she discovers that the unexpected result is due to                   the influence of two characters of the nervous system. This                   not only provokes her to examine those characters in more detail,                   but also to gather molecular data. The molecular data set, on                   60 taxa and 1500 nucleotides, is too large to get exact solutions                   from PAUP*. PAUP*'s heuristic algorithms, combined with her                   ability to suggest and examine alternative trees in MacClade,                   convince her that the optimal trees for both data sets agree                   that the two species are not sister species. Although she had                   no intention of looking at fossil species, she realizes that                   this result suggests that their peculiar shared morphology might                   be primitive and old. By using the stratigraphic character type                   in MacClade, she discovers the minimum age of the ancestor in                   which the morphology was apparently derived was Paleocene, much                   older than the group of predators against which the morphology                   was thought to be a defense.<BR>                </LI>                <LI>A population biologist has been studying the adaptive advantages                   of larval dispersal strategies. Although his past studies have                   focused on measuring risks and fecundities at two study sites                   in the Gulf of California, he realizes that his hypotheses could                   be tested by seeing if it accurately predicts a species' strategy                   according to its ecological position. After talking to a phylogenetic                   biologist, he reluctantly admits that his question is actually                   one of phylogenetic correlation between ecology and strategy.                   He finds a collaborator working on the phylogeny of the group,                   and together they use MacClade to map the evolution of larval                   dispersal strategies on the phylogenetic tree. He discovers                   that the correlation between strategy and ecology is not nearly                   as strong as he would have hoped, but he notices on MacClade's                   character tracing that the two groups on the phylogenetic tree                   with a special dispersal strategy also have the most species.                   His study shifts to an examination of the influence of dispersal                   strategy on speciation and extinction. After accumulating known                   phylogenies from numerous groups and exploring them with MacClade,                   a clear correlation emerges between speciation success and the                   special dispersal strategy. Itching to get back to his study                   sites, he discovers that his newly acquired familiarity with                   trees can be applied to his populations to examine patterns                   of dispersal and gene flow using reconstructed gene trees. He                   uses MacClade's random tree and random character generation                   to formulate null models to test his population hypotheses.<BR>                </LI>                <LI>A molecular biologist studying cell surface proteins in a                   herbivorous insect suspects that a particular domain might be                   involved in binding secondary compounds made by the host plants.                   A direct chemical approach to demonstrate binding proves difficult,                   but the genes coding for this protein have been sequenced in                   several dozen related species. Using MacClade to help reconstruct                   the phylogeny of the species and to chart how evolutionary changes                   of amino acids are distributed along the length of the protein,                   she finds that this domain is indeed the most rapidly evolving.                   Furthermore, by comparing the phylogenies of the insect and                   the plant host using Page's COMPONENT (1993), she makes a convincing                   case that one of the insect groups arose with a shift to a new                   plant host that had powerful and diverse secondary compounds.                   Not only did MacClade reconstruct many amino acid changes along                   that branch of the insect phylogenetic tree, but it also showed                   that changes in other amino acids were concentrated in the clade                   of insects living on noxious hosts. With such evidence that                   the domain was evolving in response to host secondary compounds,                   the molecular biologist faced with renewed vigor the direct                   chemical approach to examining the binding.<BR>                </LI>                <LI>An evolutionary biologist teaching a basic evolution course                   wants to introduce students to phylogenetic reconstruction.                   In a live demonstration MacClade is used first to help students                   picture phylogenetic trees in their minds' eyes. Then, the concept                   of fit between a tree and a character is shown via MacClade's                   character tracing. Students are given an example data set and                   let loose. Soon they are moving branches around with increasing                   rapidity, treating the search for parsimonious trees like a                   video game, competing against one another for shorter trees.                   In the process they discover that grouping by derived similarity                   will gain them shorter trees. One of them notices that one character                   disagrees with most of the remaining characters on whatever                   tree they can find. Indeed, on the parsimonious trees this character                   shows many cases of convergence. Another character is found                   that is similarly convergent, and students discuss what evolutionary                   processes might lead to the two characters having correlated                   evolutionary changes. </LI>              </OL>              <P>&nbsp;</P>              <P>These scenarios illustrate the varied uses of a phylogenetic                 perspective, and of MacClade in making it accessible. </P>              <!-- #EndEditable --></font></td>
