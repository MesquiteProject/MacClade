Maddison and David R. Maddison<BR><BR>This page contains some commonly asked questions about MacClade 3, orquestions that illustrate particular techniques in using MacClade.<HR><FONT SIZE="+2"><STRONG>Q:</STRONG></FONT> Is MacClade 3 Y2KCompliant? That is, will it function correctly after 1 January2000?</P><P><FONT SIZE="+2"><STRONG>A:</STRONG></FONT> Yes.<HR><FONT SIZE="+2"><STRONG>Q:</STRONG></FONT> Will MacClade 3.08 runcorrectly on a Macintosh running system 8.5 or a PowerMacintoshG3?</P><P><FONT SIZE="+2"><STRONG>A:</STRONG></FONT> As far as we know. Wehave not experienced problems running MacClade with this system.<HR><FONT SIZE="+2"><STRONG>Q:</STRONG></FONT> Will MacClade 3.08 runcorrectly on Mac OS X?</P><P><FONT SIZE="+2"><STRONG>A:</STRONG></FONT> We don't think so. Weare preparing version 4, which is designed to operate properly underMac OS X.<HR><FONT SIZE="+2"><STRONG>Q:</STRONG></FONT> Why do I always get thismessage about missing fonts when I start up MacClade 3.05 orlater?</P><P><FONT SIZE="+2"><STRONG>A:</STRONG></FONT> When MacClade 3.05 orlater starts up, it looks for the font MacCladeSmall. You need toinstall this font by either placing the MacClade Font File that camewith MacClade 3.05 in the same folder as MacClade, or by installingit into your system. If you have System 7 or later, this can beaccomplished by placing the Font File into you System Folder; if youhave an earlier system, you should install the Font File using theFont/DA mover, as documented in your Macintosh documentation.<HR><FONT SIZE="+2"><STRONG>Q:</STRONG></FONT> Is there a version ofMacClade for the PowerMac?</P><P><FONT SIZE="+2"><STRONG>A:</STRONG></FONT> MacClade 3 runs onPowerMacs, but slowly. MacClade 3 is compiled for the oldergeneration of Macintoshes (those with a 680x0 processor), not aPowerMac (which uses a PowerPC processor). A PowerMac has to runMacClade 3 under emulation (pretending to be a 680x0 machine), and sois slower than it would be if it were compiled for a PowerMac.</P><P>Version 4 of MacClade is available in 680x0 and PowerPC versions.<HR><FONT SIZE="+2"><STRONG>Q:</STRONG></FONT> Can MacClade draw trees sothat the branches have lengths proportional to the amount of changeon each branch?</P><P><FONT SIZE="+2"><STRONG>A:</STRONG></FONT> MacClade has been ablesince version 3.0 to print trees with branch lengths proportional toamount of reconstructed change (p. 349). Since version 3.02 thescreen display in the tree window could also show branch lengthsproportional to change This feature is available only when Trace AllChanges is active, because it obtains the lengths from thecalculations of Trace All Changes. MacClade cannot yet read inpreviously calculated or user-specified branch lengths. If younonetheless want to use MacClade to draw a tree with a set of branchlengths that you specify, you can create a fictitious set ofcharacters for your taxa, one binary character for each branch, andweight each character proportionally to the desired length of thecorresponding branch. Then, activate Trace All Changes using theweighted option, making sure that those ficticious characters are theonly included characters.<HR><FONT SIZE="+2"><STRONG>Q:</STRONG></FONT> I have a large DNAsequence data matrix and I want to delete some characters (forinstance, the uninformative ones) but I want to remember the originalposition in the sequence of each of the characters retained. How do Ido it?</P><P><FONT SIZE="+2"><STRONG>A:</STRONG></FONT> You can remember theoriginal positions by naming them before characters are deleted. Dothis by selecting the row of character names (or column, if thematrix is transposed) in the Data Editor. The character names are inthe cells between the data themselves and the character numbers. Toselect the whole row, click on the cell for the first character'sname, then while holding down Shift, touch on the cell for the lastcharacter's name. Then choose Fill from the Utilities menu (pp. 173and 328 of the MacClade book). If you indicate, for instance, to fillthe selected characters with "s" plus numbers beginning with 1, thecharacters will be named "s1", "s2", and so on. They will retainthese names when some are deleted, thus recording their originalpositions. You might also want to make sure you set the codonpositions (pp. 325-327 of book) before deleting the characters so theoriginal codon positions are remembered as well.<HR><FONT SIZE="+2"><STRONG>Q:</STRONG></FONT> I have a DNA sequence dataset and I find it difficult to scan the matrix to see patterns ofsequence differences. Can MacClade indicate A, C, G and T indifferent colors?</P><P><FONT SIZE="+2"><STRONG>A:</STRONG></FONT> Yes. If you have a DNAor RNA data file and you hold down the option key when you are in theData Editor, you will see that the Match First menu item underDisplay changes to become the Color States menu item. Select it, andit will show A, C, G and T as different colors. (This ratherprimitive display has been significantly improved in MacClade 4.)<HR><FONT SIZE="+2"><STRONG>Q:</STRONG></FONT> I stored a tree using theStore Tree menu item, with a character traced on it and variousstates fixed on certain branches. I then performed other activitieswith MacClade 3, using Trace All Changes, making charts, and so on.When I went to restore that stored tree using the Trees menu item, Ifound the tree no longer had the character traced on it. Why not?</P><P><FONT SIZE="+2"><STRONG>A:</STRONG></FONT> MacClade's Store Treestores the tree alone; it does not store a snapshot of the treeincluding character tracing and so forth as it appeared when stored.Thus, when you ask for the tree again, the tree is restored, but thecalculations and graphics done with it are those that are in effectwhen the tree is restored. The only tree that has fixings of statesstored with it is the tree on screen at the time a data file issaved. The trees saved with Store Tree lose their fixings of states.<HR><FONT SIZE="+2"><STRONG>Q:</STRONG></FONT> My tree has one cladewhose position is unstable. I want to explore possible placements ofthe clade. I could try moving this clade to all other possible placesand check the treelength for each placement, but that would take toomuch time. Is there a way for MacClade to help me see quickly whichplacements are best and which are worst?</P><P><FONT SIZE="+2"><STRONG>A:</STRONG></FONT> MacClade can be used toproduce a table listing the length of the tree for each possiblerooting of a clade (p. 221). If all of your characters are undirected(unordered, ordered, Dollo, symmetrical stepmatrix not violating thetriangle inequality), then this feature can be used to tell you whatyou need to know. First, reroot the tree so the root is between theunstable clade and the rest of the tree. This will not affect thetreelength because the characters are undirected. Then, expand whatis now the clade of the rest of the tree using the magnifying glasstool so it occupies the tree window. At this point, it is a good ideato print the tree with branch numbers shown (p. 233). Then hold downthe Option key and choose the All Rootings menu item in the Treesmenu (as described on p. 221), then do a Treelengths chart (p. 285),saving lengths to a text file (p. 275). The text file resulting willshow the lengths of trees named according to the number of the branchon which the clade was rerooted to make that tree. You will need toturn over the clade in your mind to place its root back in itsoriginal position to interpret these results, or you could print thetree in its original form and mark on its branches the numbers thosebranches had received in the rerooted version.<HR><FONT SIZE="+2"><STRONG>Q:</STRONG></FONT> I have a character thatshows five 0 to 1 changes and no 1 to 0 changes. It seems as thoughthat should indicate that gains are more likely than losses, but I'mworried that this pattern could be due to just a low rate ofevolution starting from an ancestral state of 0. Can MacClade help medecide if it's significant?</P><P><FONT SIZE="+2"><STRONG>A:</STRONG></FONT> Use MacClade's EvolveCharacters to simulate character evolution under the null model. Setthe ancestral state to 0 and choose a fairly low probability ofchange. Evolve lots of characters on your tree, then do a Changes&amp; Stasis chart to show reconstructed numbers of gains and losses.This will give you a notion of the average reconstructed imbalancebetween gains and losses. To find the probability of a charactershowing all gains given it showed five changes, you could find allthe simulated characters showing 5 steps (e.g. in the CharacterStatus window), exclude all other characters, and then do aSteps/etc. chart by character (top middle option) set for changes andapplying the restriction of only 0 to 1 changes. Count what fractionof the characters that show 5 changes so restricted.<HR>Copyright &copy; 1995 by Wayne P. Maddison and David R. Maddison<BR>All rights reserved.<HR></P></BODY></HTML>
