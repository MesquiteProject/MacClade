<HR><FONT SIZE=+2><STRONG>Q:</STRONG></FONT> 	еее I am trying to determine what characters support one island verses another, or two collections of trees with and without a clade monophyletic.  How can I use MacClade to help me with this?<P><FONT SIZE=+2><STRONG>A:</STRONG></FONT> 	еее compare two treefiles.<HR><FONT SIZE=+2><STRONG>Q:</STRONG></FONT> 	еее I have a tree file produced by PAUP and I want to see if the trees tend to indicate whether state 0 is more likely to change to state 1 or 2.  I know I could use the Changes and Stasis chart and summarize over all the trees in the tree file, but the problem is that many of the trees are polytomous due to collapsing of zero-length branches.  I could ask the chart to choose a random resolution for each tree, but I'd rather examine all possible resolutions of each of the trees.  How can I do it?<P><FONT SIZE=+2><STRONG>A:</STRONG></FONT> 	еееWell, the answer here is really a suggestion as to how to deal with PAUP, since MacClade will not yet try all possible resolutions.  You could ask PAUP to redo the search, this time not collapsing zero-length branches.  The trouble is, you may have to keep raising MAXTREES until it is too high for available memory.  There is a trick you can use to get PAUP to write all possible resolutions of the trees into a tree file.  In your data file create a PAUP block that contains to commands to:BUT MACCLADE CAN"T USE APPENDED TREE FILES SINCE SEPARATEW TREE BLOCKS AND MACCLADE SQUAWKS.  IT WOULD BE NICE TO TELL PEOPLE HOW TO GET AROUND THIS PROBLEM.  ANY IDEAS?<HR><FONT SIZE=+2><STRONG>Q:</STRONG></FONT> 	I have used MacClade for seven years and published 15 important papers that used it for phylogenetic analysis.  A pattern has emerged that may be fundamental to evolutionary biology.  Every tree that MacClade has given me has been a perfectly pectinate tree, and the order of taxa parallels that in the data matrix.  What process could be responsible for this remarkable result?<P><FONT SIZE=+2><STRONG>A:</STRONG></FONT> 	The process responsible is probably failure to read the MacClade manuals!  MacClade does not give you trees, you give it trees (except for its minimal automatic branch rearrangement capabilities, p. 226)!  The Default Ladder, Default Bush, or Random Trees MacClade gives you when you are starting a new data file are in no way based on the data; they are simply starting trees which you are to rearrange to explore trees of your specification.<HR><FONT SIZE=+2><STRONG>Q:</STRONG></FONT> 	Richard R. Hudson (pers. comm.) has noted that the null model of gene flow being tested by  the random-joining tree test described on p. еее of the MacClade book is not simply one of panmixia, but a null model of panmixia and neutrality combined.  If neutrality is violated we would not expect the distribution of tree shapes given by random-joining trees.  He suggested that we hold the tree topology fixed, leaving its shape as a given that could have been influenced by selection, and test for panmixia alone by reshuffling the geographic states of the taxa (the model еее of Maddison and Slatkin).  How can this be done in MacClade?<P><FONT SIZE=+2><STRONG>A:</STRONG></FONT> 	You will need to use the Data Editor .  Select the character recording geographic states and Multiply it as many times as you want replicates.  Select those replicates and use the Shuffle menu item.  Then exclude all character other than those replicates, and go to the tree window, and do a Character Steps/etc. chart (top left option) to see the distribution of the s statistic.<HR><FONT SIZE=+2><STRONG>Q:</STRONG></FONT> 	I recently read in a review of MacClade 3 by Mike Sanderson (Systematic Biology , 42(2):218-220, 1993) that MacClade can use ACCTRAN and DELTRAN when printing Trace All Changes, and that еееее.  I can't find this in the book.  What gives?<P><FONT SIZE=+2><STRONG>A:</STRONG></FONT> 	These were errors in the review.  ACCTRAN and DELTRAN are not available when printing trees with the Trace All Changes options, and are available for screen display and printing for single characters.  We have no plans to make ACCTRAN and DELTRAN available for Trace All Changes.  As well, shortly after the review was submitted, version 3.02 was released, which added the capability to display, in the tree window, branch lengths proportional to number of reconstructed changes (as discussed above in the first Question and Answer).<HR><FONT SIZE=+2><STRONG>Q:</STRONG></FONT> 	I recently read in a review of MacClade 3 by Melissa Luckow (Amer. Soc. Plant Taxonomists Newsletter , 7(4):еее, 1993) that "there is no automatic function to prevent character numbers on short branches from writing over themselves" when using Trace All Changes with the еее option.  Is this true?<P><FONT SIZE=+2><STRONG>A:</STRONG></FONT> 	No.  Since version 3.02 there has been the option to display branches (in the tree window) with their lengths proportional to the number of reconstructed changes (choose the option in Tree Size & Shape).  When this is done, the branches are stretched to accommodate the listing of characters changing in Trace All Changes.
