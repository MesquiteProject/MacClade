Maddison<BR><BR>In this section of the newsletter, we hope to have suggestions for using MacClade in educational settings.  If you have used MacClade in teaching, and would like to share your experiences and suggestions with others, please drop us a line.  Feedback will also help us plan an educational version of MacClade.   [Wayne: this is cobbled together from other notes, so it needs to be totally reworked...]<P>How you teach using MacClade depends upon what you want to teach and who you are teaching it to.  If you want to teach phylogenetic inference to an introductory audience, you might pick a small data set (e.g. Vertebrates), and have them play with it. I would also have them gather their own data on either a group of real organisms or something imaginary (one class had a "field" trip down to the local comic store, bought a pile of Disney comics, and gathered a matrix of Pluto, Donald Duck,...). We would recommend real organisms, although the latter seemed successful. <P>If the goal is to teach them why we should care about phylogeny, or to study character evolution on phylogeny, then there is more of a challenge. I would pick some literature examples where someone examined character evolution on a phylogeny and have the students repeat the analysis. I have done this with Mitochondrial Eve as well as Sillen-Tullberg's caterpillar evolution example from Evolution. Donoghue's dioecy example from Evolution might also be good. Another good thing is to pick a data set that includes plants of known pharmacological importance, and groups of unknown status: the goal of the students is to then infer the phylogeny so they know which plants would be best to target for future studies. (this can be done for biocontrol agents, food plants,...) <P>
