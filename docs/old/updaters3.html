Maddison<BR>28 April 1999<BR>The last version of MacClade was 3.08.</P><P>Updater files, that allow one to convert versions 3.0, 3.01, 3.02, 3.03, 3.04,   3.05, 3.06, and 3.07 into MacClade 3.08 can be found here: <A HREF="http://macclade.org/downloads/macclade.updater.308.sea.hqx">MacClade   Updater File</A></P><P>These update packages are placed on these computers as binhexedfiles (which can be recognized by the ".hqx" at the end of the filename. This means that they have been converted into a text-fileformat that allows for easy storage and movement between differentsorts of computers. The file will have to be de-binhexed. If you havethe appropriate communications software, this will be doneautomatically for you. Programs like Fetch and Turbogopherautomatically de-binhex files as they are being moved from the remotecomputer to your Macintosh, and will save the files on disk asself-extracting archives (indicated by ".sea" at the end of the filename). If your communications software does not provide thisfacility, the file will be saved onto your disk in bin-hex format,with ".hqx" still at the end of the file name. You will need tode-binhex the file yourself, using one of the many programs that cando this (Stuffit, Compact Pro, and DeHQX are three common examples).Once the files are de-binhexed, they will be self-extractingarchives, which you can double-click to extract the containedfiles.</P><P><HR>Copyright &copy; 1999 by Wayne P.
