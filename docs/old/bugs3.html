Maddison and David R. Maddison<BR>14 August 1996</P><P>Here is a list of the known bugs in MacClade 3.</P><P>Unless otherwise stated, bugs fixed in version 3.0x of MacCladewere present in version 3.0 through 3.0x-1. (For example, most bugsfixed in version 3.03 were present in versions 3.0-3.02.) Unlessotherwise stated, the bug was found by us and has not been reportedby a user. Bugs marked with <IMG SRC="pictures/critical.bug.gif" WIDTH=37 HEIGHT=21 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom>may affect the numerical results presented by MacClade.</P><H4>Bugs fixed in 3.01</H4><UL>   <LI><IMG SRC="pictures/critical.bug.gif" WIDTH=37 HEIGHT=21 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom>   For molecular sequence data, if States chart on screen, and data   file saved, then first line in textual summary of chart will be   bogus until you ask to have the chart recalculated. Bug in version   3.0.</LI>      <LI>If you copy to the clipboard entire rows and columns from the   data matrix, then select entire whole rows and columns that   contain different numbers of taxa and different numbers of   characters than those in the clipboard, and try to paste, MacClade   will rightly refuse to paste the data, but it will incorrectly add   new rows or columns or delete old rows and columns in the process.   Bug in version 3.0.</LI>      <LI><IMG SRC="pictures/critical.bug.gif" WIDTH=37 HEIGHT=21 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom>   For protein data matrices, if you are in the treewindow, and ask   for Type Edit under Assume, then press the New button, and choose   "Protpars type based on genetic code", and press Create, MacClade   will create a protein parsimony user-defined type. However, there   may be amino acids in the matrix that are not present in the   current genetic code (e.g., an amino acid specified as serine (S),   but not specified as to which type of serine (1 or 2) in the   standard nuclear code). MacClade would then present you with the   query "AAs not present in genetic code found in matrix: do you   wish to convert these to the appropriate AAs?" If you choose to   convert, then various statistics, including traced characters,   various charts, and so on, will not be updated. To have them   recalculated properly, return to the data editor, and then go back   to the tree window.</LI>      <LI>If you ask to Recode a character in the editor, and Footstates   is turned on, then the footstates will not be updated after the   recode.</LI>      <LI>Some of the functions for adding taxa and characters in the   editor allowed you to expand the matrix beyond the allowed 1500   taxa and 16000 characters.</LI>      <LI>If you created new user-defined types in the Type Edit dialog   box, but pressed Cancel to exit the dialog box, MacClade will   remove the newly-created types, as expected. However, the next   time you choose the Type Edit dialog box, MacClade may crash. This   crash can be avoided if you trace a character in the tree window   before you call Type Edit the second time, or if you select one   entire character in the data editor just before calling Type   Edit.</LI></UL><H4>Bugs fixed in 3.02</H4><UL>   <LI>Taxon, character, and state names cannot consist entirely of   numbers. MacClade mistakenly allowed names that consisted of   number followed by blanks or underscores. Bug reported by one   user.</LI>      <LI>If you copy a complex picture (perhaps a color image) to the   Clipboard in another program, then switch to MacClade, MacClade   may crash if that picture takes more than 32K of memory.</LI>      <LI>There were a few minor problems with the vertical positioning   of the tree in the treewindow and the vertical scroll bar in some   circumstances, especially when Data Boxes were turned on. This   occasionally resulted in one part of the tree appearing at a   different level than another part.</LI>      <LI>If taxon labels in the tree window were any style other than   plain (that is, bold, italics, etc.), then the labels for the bars   on branches in Trace All Changes mode were also mistakenly of this   style.</LI>      <LI>If you used the drag-and-drop rerooting tool, and touched on a   branch, but did not move the tool off the branch before you let go   of the mouse button, MacClade would crash. Bug reported by three   users.</LI>      <LI>On occasion MacClade would query you to save a tree file when   closing a data file, even though no tree file was open.</LI>      <LI>On a Macintosh with a 16 or more colors or grays shown,   MacClade occasionally incorrectly printed Data Boxes.</LI>      <LI><IMG SRC="pictures/critical.bug.gif" WIDTH=37 HEIGHT=21 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom>   If Trace All Changes is shown, with Minimum and Maximum changes,   and you went to Print Tree, and choose Multiple Trees from the   Options pop-up menu, then asked to print multiple trees, MacClade   would incorrectly show changes on the printed trees, and would   give some error messages. Bug reported by two users.</LI>      <LI>If you asked to not show the trace legend in Print Tree, this   request was forgotten the next time you invoked Print Tree. Bug   reported by one user.</LI>      <LI>If you asked to print Data Boxes from within Print Tree,   printing might not take place until you left the Print Tree dialog   box.</LI>      <LI>On occasion the preview image in the Print Tree dialog box was   not updated correctly. Bug reported by one user.</LI>      <LI>If a data file in MacClade 2.1 format contained an invalid   tree description, with one taxon occurring more than once,   MacClade 3 would usually crash upon reading the file or displaying   the tree. Bug reported by one user.</LI>      <LI>In Trace All Changes, if the number of changes varied by less   than 10 across branches, but the maximum number of changes on any   branch is greater than 10, and if the trace was indicated with   patterns or colors, then the legend would incorrectly label the   patterns or colors.</LI>      <LI>In the Character Steps/etc. chart, if one chooses the chart   with number of steps on the vertical axis and character number on   the horizontal, and changes the interval width to something other   than 1 (see pp. 276&endash;277 of the MacClade book), then   MacClade may crash if the number of characters is not divisible by   the interval width. Bug reported by one user.</LI>      <LI>If you modify the Evolve Segments of various branches, then   save the file, there are occasions in which the number of segments   of the right-most branch on the tree will be incorrectly set on   re-opening the file. Bug present only in version 3.01.</LI>      <LI>Occasionally a scroll bar will be incorrectly drawn in the   textual summary of a State Changes &amp; Stasis chart. Bug present   only in version 3.01.</LI>      <LI><IMG SRC="pictures/critical.bug.gif" WIDTH=37 HEIGHT=21 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom>   If a chart is on the screen, and Evolve Characters is invoked, and   there are fewer states per character in the simulated characters   than in some of the original characters, then the chart may be   drawn incorrectly, omitting some of the higher-valued states.</LI>      <LI>When an observed taxon is fixed as ancestor then holding the   cursor over the corresponding internal branch should cause the   message box to indicate the taxon's name, but instead it indicates   garbage if the internal branch is a left-leaning branch.</LI>      <LI><IMG SRC="pictures/critical.bug.gif" WIDTH=37 HEIGHT=21 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom>   Whenever the State Changes &amp; Stasis chart was used and   observed taxa were fixed as ancestors, the chart gave false   results. The results included ficticious changes that varied   haphazardly according to situation.</LI>      <LI>In printing Char. &amp; State Names from the Print Other   submenu, the last character listed on each page may have some   states omitted from the list. Bug reported by one user.</LI>      <LI><IMG SRC="pictures/critical.bug.gif" WIDTH=37 HEIGHT=21 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom>   In printing Branch Lists from the Print Other submenu, all pages   after the first may have the first line of the page printed at the   bottom of the page, thus giving the incorrect impression that a   character changes along the branch listed at the bottom of the   page, rather than that listed at the top of the page. Bug reported   by one user.</LI>      <LI><IMG SRC="pictures/critical.bug.gif" WIDTH=37 HEIGHT=21 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom>   In Trace All Changes, if branch lengths are weighted, and if   decimal-valued weights or user-defined types are in use, then in   Print Tree, if you choose to show the scale of the branch lengths,   then the scale will be labeled incorrectly.</LI></UL><H4>Bugs fixed in 3.03</H4><UL>   <LI>On rare occasion, MacClade will refuse to open files from the   Open File menu item. This seems to be restricted to hard disks   that have been extensively used since last formatted, and that use   System 7. Bug reported by six users.</LI>      <LI>For Extended Standard or protein data files, if Type Edit   opens to display a step matrix type with 8 or less states, and you   then display a type with 10 or more states, the scroll bars will   overlap part of the step matrix. Bug reported by one user.</LI></UL><H4>Bugs fixed in 3.04</H4><UL>   <LI>If Minimum-Average-Maximum Trace All Changes is shown on a   tree, and you go to Print Tree and have the tree drawn with branch   lengths proportional to number of changes, and ask to print Data   Boxes, the taxon names will be printed in the incorrect place. Bug   reported by one user.</LI>      <LI>If a taxon has footnotes attached to more than one of the   characters, then MacClade may fail to print some of these   footnotes if they appear near the bottom of a page. Bug reported   by one user.</LI>      <LI>In the Print Tree dialog box, if you click on the Print Tree   button, but then click on the Cancel button to avoid printing,   MacClade may perform some unnecessary calculations.</LI>      <LI>There were times in which symbols for gaps, missing data,   etc., could conflict with those for character states, but MacClade   would not provide proper warning. For example, with a DNA data   file, you could designate a gap as 'Y', which would conflict with   the symbols list used by MacClade for the Genetic Code dialog box,   causing it to be displayed incorrectly. Bug reported by one   user.</LI>      <LI>The CHARSET command in the ASSUMPTIONS block of a NEXUS file   was occasionally misread, resulting in either a crash or very   sluggish performance. Bug reported by one user.</LI>      <LI>If you Save Preferences in the Symbols dialog box for standard   or extended standard data files, then set the default data format   preference to DNA, RNA, or protein, then any new file you create   will be designated as DNA, RNA, or protein, but will have   incorrect state symbols.</LI>      <LI>In some circumstances, touching just below the column width   control in the data editor would cause MacClade to crash.</LI>      <LI>Some options in the Trace Labeling dialog box were not saved   as preferences properly for Trace All Changes.</LI>      <LI>There were some problems in screen display in the Include   Exclude Taxa dialog box.</LI>      <LI>In exporting polytomous trees to Hennig86, MacClade would   incorrectly give a warning that the polytomies in the trees were   arbitrarily resolved.</LI>      <LI>With a continuous character traced, the trace legend would use   as its range for shading the entire range of states on the whole   tree. However, the trace would use as its range that on the   currently shown clade. Since the ranges determine the assignment   of shades/patterns to states, the trace could therefore disagree   with the legend when a clade was expanded on the screen. This was   fixed by using range on whole tree for both Trace Continuous and   Trace All Changes (since adjustment to expanded clade was deemed   undesirable).</LI>      <LI>If one imported a foreign file format in which some characters   were specified as not being of default type for that file format   (e.g. a Hennig86 file with some characters being unordered), then   when that file was saved within MacClade, the current typeset was   occasionally saved incorrectly (e.g. a Hennig86 file may have been   saved with all character ordered).</LI>      <LI>Switching the number of significant digits for indices such as   the retention index was not immediately reflected in the screen   display.</LI></UL><H4>Bugs fixed in 3.05</H4><UL>   <LI>PHYLIP 3.4/3.5 data files that contained trees were written   incorrectly. After the data matrix, but before the trees, a line   is supposed to be included containing the number of trees. This   line was not written into the files.</LI>      <LI>If you tried to import some files as MacClade 1.0 or 2.1   files, when in fact they were files of another format (e.g.   PHYLIP), then MacClade would occasionally crash. Bug reported by   one user.</LI>      <LI>Some files (e.g., in simple table format) in which there were   several carriage returns or linefeeds after the last character   state symbol could not be imported into MacClade.</LI>      <LI>When a taxon was deleted from the matrix, the trees stored in   memory were sometimes adjusted incorrectly for the deletion of the   taxon if the taxon had been placed as arising out of a polytomous   node (and certain other conditions held) &#91;namely, in the   polytomy's "ghost" resolution, the taxon is at the base of the   polytomous clade.&#93;</LI>      <LI>If the number of text characters contained in all of the   footnotes stored in a data file exceeded 32,000, the footnotes can   become corrupted. Bug reported by three users.</LI>      <LI>If Track Cell was turned off in the Edit menu in the data   editor, then text characters typed into the cell of a taxon or   character name were not displayed immediately. Bug reported by one   user.</LI>      <LI>The character sets written in TYPESETs, WTSETs, and similar   objects in the NEXUS file were occasionally written in a redundant   fashion in protein-coding nucleotide sequences.</LI>      <LI>Names of user-defined character types that contained a period   ('.') were occasionally altered by MacClade.</LI>      <LI><IMG SRC="pictures/critical.bug.gif" WIDTH=37 HEIGHT=21 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom>   Weight sets, type sets, inclusion sets, character sets, and codon   positions are saved incorrectly for DNA and RNA sequence data if   these sets have odd patterns (for example, if sites 1, 3, 4, 7, 9,   10, 12, 13 were excluded, this would be saved incorrectly, but if   every third site were excluded,this would be saved properly). This   may lead to incorrect results if the altered assumptions are not   noticed. Bug present only in version 3.04. Bug reported by one   user.</LI>      <LI><IMG SRC="pictures/critical.bug.gif" WIDTH=37 HEIGHT=21 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom>   If a block of cells is moved toward the start of the matrix in the   data editor (using the Block Moves feature), and is moved off the   start of the matrix (by holding down the Option key), and if the   characters that are moved off of the matrix contain no data (e.g.   are all missing), then the remaining cells moved in the block will   be reassigned the state present in the highest-num ber charactcer.   (We know this sounds complicated, but you would know it if it   happened to you!) Bug reported by one user.</LI>      <LI>If the tree on the screen has been given a name, and then   different branch segments are assigned to the various branches,   and the file saved, the branch segment information will be lost   when the file is reopened.</LI>      <LI>On Mac 660AV and 840AV's, MacClade will on occasion present   the user with a -35 error, and will refuse to open many files   subsequently. Reported by four users. This is the "Stern AV Bug",   which took about 7 months to track down; thanks to David Stern for   his heroic efforts in helping us figure this one out.</LI>      <LI>If you have user-defined types, and then change the format of   the matrix (e.g. from standard data to DNA data) in such a way   that the maximum state number in the new matrix is less than that   present in the user-defined type, then MacClade may crash if you   subsequently choose to edit types.</LI></UL><H4>Bugs fixed in 3.06</H4><UL>   <LI>If you read in a NEXUS file that has a data matrix with states   represented by numbers other than 0 and 1, but that does not   contain a FORMAT statement in a DATA or CHARACTERS block, then   MacClade will incorrectly display the states in the data editor   using some odd symbols, such as boxes. Bug in versions   3.0-3.05.</LI>      <LI>The Search and Replace feature was inadvertently disabled in   MacClade 3.05.</LI>      <LI>With DNA or RNA sequence data, the program would sometimes   save weightsets, typesets, etc., with bogus character numbers   (specifically, it would save the weight for a non-existent   character). This shouldn't cause any significant problems, other   than making the file unreadable by other programs like PAUP   without modification. Bug in versions 3.04-3.05.</LI>      <LI>There were several instances where MacClade would give   incorrect warnings about conflicts between state symbols and   symbols used for missing data, gaps, and the matching character   symbol. Bug in versions 3.0-3.05.</LI>      <LI>In some circumstances modal states were written incorrectly in   molecular sequence files. Bug in versions 3.0-3.05.</LI></UL><H4>Bugs fixed in 3.07</H4><UL>   <LI>Some problems in importing and exporting PHYLIP files.</LI></UL><H4>Bugs fixed in 3.08</H4><UL>   <LI>Some weight sets, type sets, and inclusion sets were   incorrectly written by previous versions.</LI>      <LI>Crash if one deleted thousands of characters at once.</LI>      <LI>PHYLIP files with taxon names right-justified were read   incorrectly.</LI>      <LI>The keyword "(STEPMATRIX)" was not recognized in a USERTYPE   definition in a NEXUS file</LI>      <LI><IMG SRC="pictures/critical.bug.gif" WIDTH=37 HEIGHT=21 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom>   If you used Compress Characters, and a single cell was selected,   then the information would be incorrectly transported to another   cell.</LI>      <LI>There were problems with some punctuation marks if used in   taxa, character, or state names.</LI>      <LI>Couldn't read state names if the matrix was transposed and   MacClade was set to write files in the updated NEXUS format.</LI></UL><H4>Unfixed Bugs</H4><UL>   <LI>Occasionally MacClade will give a warning, when going back to   the tree window, that MacClade had difficulty in restoring the   Evolve Segments. This can occur whether or not you have set the   evolve segments. If you see this behavior, please report it to   us.</LI>      <LI>MacClade 3 cannot read files that are on an MSDOS-formatted   floppy disk.</LI></UL><H4>"Suboptimalities" we haven't done anything about yet</H4><UL>   <LI>When an already-existing file is saved by MacClade, its   "Created" time (as seen in the Get Info window in the Finder) is   reset to be the same as its "Modified" time.</LI>      <LI>When MacClade is open but no files are open, then   double-clicking on a MacClade file in the Finder of System 7   should cause MacClade to read in that file. This does not happen.   This is caused by a change in the file management software in   Apple's systems.</LI></UL><H4>Other Anomalies</H4><P>These are "anomalies" that are apparently not MacClade'sfault.</P><UL>   <LI>Circle trees are not printed properly on some printers.   Apparently this is a bug in some printer drivers. We have noticed   this with Laserwriter driver 8.1.1; circle trees print fine with   Laserwriter driver 8.2.</LI></UL></BODY></HTML>
