For almost all features other than the ones mentionedherein, MacClade 4 works exactly as does MacClade 3.07.</P><P>Bug reports to David, <A HREF="mailto:beetle@ag.arizona.edu">beetle@ag.arizona.edu</A>,please; any suggestions for new features also very much welcomed.</P><P>This version of MacClade is still a test version. Many of the newfeatures are only partly developed; there are a few screen displayproblems, especially in the data editor. It is an alpha test version,which means that it does not have all of the features planned for thefinal release.</P><P>There may be some worse bugs. Use with caution. As always withtest software, make sure you back up your files before using thisversion.</P><P>In the following notes, known bugs are marked with a <IMG SRC="mc4picts/bugs.gif" WIDTH=19 HEIGHT=18 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom>.</P><P>Notes on features to add or alter are marked with <IMG SRC="mc4picts/todo.gif" WIDTH=42 HEIGHT=38 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom>.</P><H3>Contents</H3><BLOCKQUOTE><DL>      <DT><IMG SRC="mc4picts/dot.gif" WIDTH=11 HEIGHT=11 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH ALIGN=bottom>      <STRONG> </STRONG><A HREF="#generalaspects"><STRONG>General      Aspects</STRONG></A><STRONG> </STRONG></DT>            <DT><IMG SRC="mc4picts/dot.gif" WIDTH=11 HEIGHT=11 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom>      <STRONG> </STRONG><A HREF="#dataeditor"><STRONG>Data      Editor</STRONG></A><STRONG> </STRONG></DT>            <DT><IMG SRC="mc4picts/dot.gif" WIDTH=11 HEIGHT=11 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom>      <STRONG> </STRONG><A HREF="#statenames"><STRONG>State Names      &amp; Symbols Window</STRONG></A><STRONG> </STRONG></DT>            <DT><IMG SRC="mc4picts/dot.gif" WIDTH=11 HEIGHT=11 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom>      <STRONG> </STRONG><A HREF="#listwindows"><STRONG>List      Windows</STRONG></A><STRONG> </STRONG></DT>            <DT><IMG SRC="mc4picts/dot.gif" WIDTH=11 HEIGHT=11 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom>      <STRONG> </STRONG><A HREF="#selecting"><STRONG>Selecting      Objects</STRONG></A><STRONG> </STRONG></DT>            <DT><IMG SRC="mc4picts/dot.gif" WIDTH=11 HEIGHT=11 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom>      <STRONG> </STRONG><A HREF="#nexus"><STRONG>NEXUS Block      management</STRONG></A><STRONG> </STRONG></DT>            <DT><IMG SRC="mc4picts/dot.gif" WIDTH=11 HEIGHT=11 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom>      <STRONG> </STRONG><A HREF="#treewindow"><STRONG>Tree      Window</STRONG></A><STRONG> </STRONG></DT>            <DT><IMG SRC="mc4picts/dot.gif" WIDTH=11 HEIGHT=11 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom>      <STRONG> </STRONG><A HREF="#miscellaneous"><STRONG>Miscellaneous</STRONG></A><STRONG>      </STRONG></DT>            <DT><IMG SRC="mc4picts/dot.gif" WIDTH=11 HEIGHT=11 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom>      <STRONG> </STRONG><A HREF="#miscellaneous"><STRONG>Things to do      before release of version 4</STRONG></A><STRONG> </STRONG></DT>   </DL></BLOCKQUOTE><H2><HR><A NAME=generalaspects></A><IMG SRC="mc4picts/maccladeicon.gif" WIDTH=39 HEIGHT=32 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom>GeneralAspects</H2><H3>PowerPC version</H3><P>One big change is that there is now a PowerPC native version ofMacClade. (MacClade 3.07 is a 68K program, which means it runsrelatively slowly on PowerMacs.)</P><H3>Preferences</H3><P>For MacClade version 4, the preferences system was completelyrewritten. This was necessary in part to make it much easier toupdate, and in part to make it work under MacOS X. A consequence ofthis that most previous preferences will not be processed byMacClade, and you will need to reset them.</P><H3>Closing windows and files</H3><P>- now, Command-W closes the frontmost window; this will close thefile only if it is the last window open in MacClade.</P><H3>Background operations</H3><P>Many operations are now backgroundable; that is, you can bringanother application to the forefront and let MacClade carry oncalculations in the background.</P><P><IMG SRC="mc4picts/bugs.gif" WIDTH=19 HEIGHT=18 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom>you won't be notified if an error is encountered in MacClade when itis in the background<BR><IMG SRC="mc4picts/bugs.gif" WIDTH=19 HEIGHT=18 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom>sometimes when MacClade is calculating in the background it hogs toomuch processing time.</P><H3>Menu reorganization &amp; enabling/disabling</H3><P>Assume and Format menus subsumed into Characters menu. Taxa menuis new; Tree menu is reorganized.</P><P><IMG SRC="mc4picts/bugs.gif" WIDTH=19 HEIGHT=18 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom>Some menu items are enabled when they should be disabled(grayed).</P><H2><HR><A NAME=dataeditor></A><IMG SRC="mc4picts/maccladeicon.gif" WIDTH=39 HEIGHT=32 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom>Dataeditor</H2><P>Many changes, as described below.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H3>Alignment Tools</H3><P>See <A HREF="#aatranslate">On-the-fly amino acid</A> translation,<A HREF="#colorcells">coloring data cells</A>, <A HREF="#alignmenttool">blockmoving tool</A>, <A HREF="#splitothers">split others tool</A>,<A HREF="#scissors">scissors tool</A>, <A HREF="#wand">selectionwand</A>, <A HREF="#selectedblock">selected block tool</A>; <A HREF="#dim">Dimcharacters</A>; <A HREF="#consensus">Consensus sequences</A>;<A HREF="#flashidentical">Find facility</A>.</P><P>If you use these tools, you might wish to choose "FrequentRedrawing" from the Show menu. This will force MacClade to redraw thecells in the editor more often than normal, thus avoiding any of thescreen redrawing errors that might be present in this version. Screenredrawing errors used a real problem with earlier developmentalversion, but is much less of a problem now. In the unlikely eventthat this version of MacClade will muck up your data, this will allowyou to detect such problems more quickly.</P><H3>Editor Tools</H3><P>The data editor now has a tool palette:</P><P><IMG SRC="mc4picts/editortools.gif" WIDTH=108 HEIGHT=149 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></P><P><IMG SRC="mc4picts/todo.gif" WIDTH=42 HEIGHT=38 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom>Thequestion marks are tools yet to be created. <B>If you have any ideasabout possible tools, please tell me!</B></P><P>(note that the selection wand and the block move tool have littletriangles in the lower right. this indicates they have pop-downmenus, allowing one to change options)</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>(for all tools, if you check Editor Tools Treat Missing As Gap inthe Edit menu, then the tools will treat missing data as the same asa gap when moving sequences around, or when using the selectiontools)</P><P>&nbsp;<IMG SRC="mc4picts/bugs.gif" WIDTH=19 HEIGHT=18 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom>some of these tools do not work appropriately if the matrix scrollsduring their use.

Inparticular, if the previous selection contains non-gaps, then it willselect blocks of data bounded by gaps; if the previous selectioncontains only gaps, then it will select the widest block of gaps forall taxa selected.</P><P>The pop-up menu, available by touching on the tool in the toolpalette, allows you to choose between various modes of behavior. Hereare the modes:</P><UL>   <LI>normal: selects blocks of single sequences</LI>      <LI>block mode, taxon priority: in one touchs on a gap, then   MacClade looks at the character touched upon, and selects as many   contiguous cells as possible for that character that contain gaps;   it then expands the selection horizontally to the largest size it   can to have a rectangle of pure gaps. So first it expands   vertically, then horizontally to get a selection of pure gaps. If   one touches on a non-gap, then it does the same thing, except that   it selects the largest block of pure non-gaps.</LI>      <LI>block mode, character priority: in one touchs on a gap, then   MacClade looks at the cell touched upon, and selects as many   contiguous cells as possible for that taxon that contain gaps; it   then expands the selection vertically to the largest size it can   to have a rectangle of pure gaps.

You will be able to move it forwardand backward through any bounding gaps; you should not be able tomove it over any nucleotides or amino acids.</P><P>the ends of this block are sticky, in that if you move it againstsome other nucleotides, then release the mouse button, then clickagain, the block will be expanded to include those additionalnucleotides.</P><P>This tool allows you to move only one sequence at a time.</P><P>I have added two checks to make sure this tool is not damagingyour data. Before moving data, this tool does a check to make sure nodata will be accidentally overwritten. After moving data, it checksto see if the frequencies of nucleotides were changes with the move.If this does change, it means MacClade did something wrong, and itwill warn you.</P><P>The popup menu for this tool has options that alter its behavior.In particular:</P><UL>   <LI>if <B>Allow Matrix Edges to Expand</B> is checked, then   MacClade will add more characters to the start or end of the   matrix to make room for sequences pushed off the start or   end.</LI>      <LI>if <B>Move Entire Sequence</B> is checked, then the entire   sequence, exclusive of terminal gaps, will be moved</LI>      <LI>If <B>Accumulate Sticky Blocks</B> is checked, then as you   move one piece along, if it bumps into another piece, then that   other piece will be joined to the first piece and you will now be   moving both pieces, as one.</LI>      <LI>if <B>Allow Block Splitting </B>is checked, then the Block   Move Tool behaves as the Split Block Tool when the mouse is over   the boundary between two cells</LI></UL><P><IMG SRC="mc4picts/bugs.gif" WIDTH=19 HEIGHT=18 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom>&nbsp;aswith some of the other alignment tools, if in using them you forceMacClade to scroll the matrix, there may be some screen displayproblems; in particular, visual remnants of old block positions maystill exist.</P><P><HR WIDTH="25%" ALIGN=left><A NAME=selectedblock></A><IMG SRC="mc4picts/selectedblock.gif" WIDTH=23 HEIGHT=20 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom>selected block tool:</P><P>an alignment tool that lets you move selected blocks in thematrix. Equivalent, more or less, to the block move tool, except thatit only works on selected blocks, and doesn't allow you to split ablock. The advantage is that it allows you to move multiple sequencesat once. Valuable in conjunction with the magic wand tool.</P><P>can drag this tool through unselected regions to select them.</P><P><HR WIDTH="25%" ALIGN=left><IMG SRC="mc4picts/splitblock.gif" WIDTH=21 HEIGHT=18 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom>splitblock tool:</P><P>- another alignment tools. allows you to split a block of data tointroduce gaps. must be used on boundaries between cells.</P><P><HR WIDTH="25%" ALIGN=left><A NAME=splitothers></A><IMG SRC="mc4picts/splitothers.gif" WIDTH=19 HEIGHT=20 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom>split others tool:</P><P>Similar to the split block tool except that it moves all sequencesOTHER than the one being dragged, and currently it moves not just onepiece of data on one side by the entire sequence on that side.</P><P>When one clicks on the boundary between two characters in onetaxon and pulls to the right or left, this tool moves all the OTHERtaxa to the right or left. For example, if one positioned the tool asshown:</P><CENTER><IMG SRC="mc4picts/splitothers1.gif" WIDTH=222 HEIGHT=110 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></CENTER><P>and pulled one column to the right, all other sequences would bemoved to the right, and gaps inserted:</P><CENTER><IMG SRC="mc4picts/splitothers2.gif" WIDTH=247 HEIGHT=117 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></CENTER><P><HR WIDTH="25%" ALIGN=left><IMG SRC="mc4picts/stamp.gif" WIDTH=22 HEIGHT=22 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom>stampclipboard tool. Select a block of cells, and copy them to theclipboard. Then choose this tool, and you will see be able to movethe clipboard contents around the edtior. To paste the contents ontoa region, click the mouse button to stamp the cells down.</P><P><HR WIDTH="25%" ALIGN=left><IMG SRC="mc4picts/popupstates.gif" WIDTH=22 HEIGHT=20 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom>pop-upstates tool. touch this on a cell, and a menu will pop up listing thestates for that character. choose one, and that state will be enteredinto that cell.</P><P>can also be used to fill all cells in a selected block.</P><P>can also be used to fill in some default names for a selected setof taxon names.</P><P><HR WIDTH="25%" ALIGN=left><IMG SRC="mc4picts/paintbucket.gif" WIDTH=23 HEIGHT=21 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom>paintbucket tool. use this tool on a selected block of cells and thatblock will be filled with the state represented by the "paint" (seethe eyedropper tool, below, for a description of the paint optionsand how one changes the paint).</P><P>- can also drag this tool over an unselected block of cells toselect them and paint them.</P><P>Modes, available in popup menu:</P><P><B>Fill with Paint</B>: the normal mode, in which the cells arefilled with the paint.<BR><B>Fill with Random</B>: cells are filled with random data, in thefrequencies set in the Fill Random dialog box in the Utilitiesmenu<BR><B>Fill with Observed States</B>: cells are filled with only thestates ALREADY PRESENT in each character, in equal frequencies. Thus,if you used that on character 2, with states 0 and 1, then the cellswould be filled with 0 or 1, each with a probability of 0.5; if youused it on character 5, with states 0,1,and 3, then the cells of thatcharacter would be filled with states 0,1, or 3, each with aprobability of 0.3333.<BR><B>Fill with Observed Frequencies</B>: cells are filled with only thestates ALREADY PRESENT in each character, with probabilitiesproportional to the observed frequencies. Thus, if you used that oncharacter 2, which had two taxa with state 0 and 8 with state 1, thenthe cells would be filled with 0 with a probability of 0.2, and 1with a probability of 0.8.</P><P><B>Restrict Fill option</B>:</P><P>This option (available in the popup menu) lets you restrict thefill, by presenting you with a dialog box containing options. If youask it to fill only cells with state X, then MacClade will ignore allother cells in the selected area, and only fill those with state X.Choosing "not (? or -)" from the popup menu in the dialog box willtell MacClade to only fill cells containing data.</P><P>You can also specify what proportion of the cells to fill. If youchoose 0.1, then MacClade will fill each of the chosen cells with aprobability of 0.1; thus, on average, only 10% of the cells will bealtered.</P><P>For example, if you asked MacClade to fill only cells with missingdata, and asked it to fill 0.5 of the cells with the observedfrequencies, then MacClade would fill 50% of the missing data withstates present in each character, and fill them in the observedfrequencies. This would allow you to investigate the effects ofmissing data.</P><P>You could also investigate the effects of errors on your data by,say, filling 0.001 of the cells containing data with random data.</P><P><HR WIDTH="25%" ALIGN=left><IMG SRC="mc4picts/paintbrush.gif" WIDTH=21 HEIGHT=21 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom>paintbrush tool. use this tool to set the state of any cell touched on tobe the state represented by the "paint" (see the eyedropper tool,below, for a description of the paint options and how one changes thepaint).</P><P><HR WIDTH="25%" ALIGN=left><IMG SRC="mc4picts/eyedropper.gif" WIDTH=21 HEIGHT=21 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom>eyedroppertool:</P><P>- touch on a cell in the matrix and MacClade will use the state inthat cell as the paint state.<BR>- touch on a taxon name or a taxon number and the paint state will bethe state present in that taxon. e.g. say taxon 5's number is touchedon, and the states for taxon 5 are 01102 for the first fivecharacters. Then using the paintbrush or paintbucket on any taxon'scharacter 1 will paint state 0, any taxon's character 2 will paintstate 1, and so on.</P><P>you can also touch on the eyedropper tool in the palette and alittle pop-up menu will appear allowing you to choose the paintstate.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H3><A NAME=consensus></A>Consensus Sequences</H3><P>Choose Consensus Sequence from the Display menu to ask MacClade toautomatically calculate Consensus Sequences. You can add as many asyou wish, and have them of different stringencies. Once added, youcan reorder them by dragging, and you can delete them by selectingthem and hiting the Delete key.</P><P>You can also move them to be true members of the matrix byselecting one of them and choosing "Transfer Consensus to Taxon" fromthe Taxa menu.</P><P>If you choose a taxon set in the Consensus Taxa submenu of theDisplay menu, then the consensus sequences will be calculated onlyover elements of that taxon set. By default the consensus iscalculated over all taxa. You must first create other taxon sets touse them in this way (do this by selecting rows in the Taxon Listwindow, and choosing Store Taxon Set from the Taxon Sets submenu ofthe Taxa menu).</P><P>When you use the Block Move tool on a piece, and if you chose"show matches during block move" in the Consensus Sequences dialogbox, the box with the name of the consensus sequence changes to havein it the total number of elements (undimmed/dimmed) in the consensussequence.</P><P><IMG SRC="mc4picts/todo.gif" WIDTH=42 HEIGHT=38 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom><B>Todo:</B><BR>- allow Match First to work against first consensus sequence ratherthan first taxon of matrix.<BR>- have consensus sequences written into NEXUS file<BR>- allow one to move consensus sequence into matrix as actualtaxon</P><H3><A NAME=aatranslate></A>On-the-fly Amino Acid Translation</H3><P>with nucleotide data, with codon positions designated (exactly asfor MacClade 3.07), in the Show submenu (Display menu), choose AATranslation. This will ask MacClade to show the nucleotides and thetranslated amino acids simultaneously (the translated AAs will appearbelow the nucleotides). You can ask to have these translated AAscolored (using the Colored AA translation menu item in the Showmenu). You can also ask to dim the nucleotides so that the AAs showup better (using the Dim Nucleotides menu item in the Displaymenu).</P><P>here is a view that shows AAs being translated, colored, with thenucleotides colored and dimmed:</P><CENTER><IMG SRC="mc4picts/aatranslation.gif" WIDTH=359 HEIGHT=86 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></CENTER><P>Valuable in conjunction with alignment tools. This translation isalso done as you move cell blocks with the alignment tools, so thatyou can see how the AAs change.</P><P><IMG SRC="mc4picts/bugs.gif" WIDTH=19 HEIGHT=18 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom>Don't try this with the editor transposed.</P><H3><A NAME=colorcells></A>Coloring data cells</H3><P>in the Show submenu, turn on Colored Cells.</P><CENTER><IMG SRC="mc4picts/colorcells.gif" WIDTH=197 HEIGHT=69 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></CENTER><P>(The colors of the cells are the same ones used for charactertracing in the Tree Window, and can be adjusted in the data editor bychoosing State Colors in the Display menu.)</P><H3><A NAME=flashidentical></A>Finding sequence pieces</H3><P>select a piece of one sequence in the editor, choose Enter FindString from Find submenu.

For the first time you now haveaccess to a Taxa list window, in which you can (among other things)define taxon sets.</P><P>In these list windows you can rename, move, or delete items,including trees, taxa, characters, weight sets, type sets, inclusionsets.</P><P>If you touch on the lock in these windows, it locks the names sothat they cannot be edited.</P><P>The list windows now have a tool bar at the bottom:</P><P><IMG SRC="mc4picts/listtools.gif" WIDTH=67 HEIGHT=26 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></P><P>The scissors tool is used to permanently remove objects.

A simpler version of this ability was present (and, for themost part, unnoticed) in MacClade 3's Character Status window.MacClade 4, however, extends this capability significantly.</P><P>In the list windows, there are three tools available at the bottomof the window:</P><CENTER><IMG SRC="mc4picts/listtools.gif" WIDTH=67 HEIGHT=26 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></CENTER><P>The selection wand will select any similar object. For example, ifyou use it on any of the columns in a list window to the right of thename column, it will select all objects with the same value in thatcolumn. For example, if you touched on a "2" in the States column inthe Character List window:</P><CENTER><IMG SRC="mc4picts/wandinlist.gif" WIDTH=361 HEIGHT=210 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></CENTER><P>&nbsp;then MacClade would select all objects that have twostates:</P><CENTER><IMG SRC="mc4picts/wandinlist2.gif" WIDTH=361 HEIGHT=210 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></CENTER><P>With this you can select all taxa without missing data, or alltrees with polytomies, or all characters of a particular weight, andso on.</P><H3>Selecting runs of gaps</H3><P>In the selection submenu in the Character List window, if youchoose "Gap Runs..." you will be presented with a dialog box, whichwill allow you to select in the Character List window all charactersthat participate in runs of gaps of defined lengths. This does notinclude terminal runs of gaps, at either end of a sequence. Forexample, in the following matrix, if you asked to select charactersparticipating in gap runs of length 2 or more, you would selectcharacters 3-5, 10-14, 18-19, as shown in the row marked "gap run of2". If you increase the length of the gap runs desired, fewer andfewer characters would be selected.</P><CENTER><IMG SRC="mc4picts/gaprun.gif" WIDTH=298 HEIGHT=250 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></CENTER><P>In general, if you ask for gap runs of length x, then if there is,in any taxon, a string of contiguous gaps of length greater than orequal to x, and imagine that string of gaps went from character y tocharacter z, then characters y through z would be selected.</P><H3>Selecting all taxa with a particular state in a character</H3><P>If you select a cell in the data matrix, and choose "Select alltaxa with same state" in the Edit menu, MacClade will present youwith the Taxon List window, with all taxa with that state in thatcharacter selected. For example, with state 2 selected in character 7in the following matrix</P><CENTER><IMG SRC="mc4picts/selectsamestate.gif" WIDTH=251 HEIGHT=229 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></CENTER><P>choosing "Select All Taxa with Same State" would cause crocodiles,lizards, birds, and snakes to be selected</P><CENTER><IMG SRC="mc4picts/selectsamestate2.gif" WIDTH=291 HEIGHT=223 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></CENTER><P>as they all have state 2 in character 7.</P><H2><HR><A NAME=nexus></A><IMG SRC="mc4picts/maccladeicon.gif" WIDTH=39 HEIGHT=32 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom>NEXUSBlock management</H2><P>MacClade files are written in the NEXUS format, a file formatshared with PAUP and other programs. NEXUS files consist of asequence of blocks of information. For example, a data file mightinclude a DATA block, an ASSUMPTIONS block, a TREE block, and soon.</P><P>MacClade looks after the creation of all of the blocks containinginformation it processes. For example, when you create a data file inMacClade, and ask MacClade to save it, it writes into the file ablock (perhaps called DATA) that contains the data matrix, names ofcharacters, etc., written in NEXUS commands. If the only program youever use is MacClade, then you can let MacClade do all of the readingand writing of NEXUS blocks for you, without ever worrying aboutthem. However, if you want to use the file in other programs, such asPAUP, it can be handy or necessary to learn how to write NEXUS blocksyourself.</P><P>This version of MacClade now allows you to create additional NEXUSblocks and edit them from within MacClade itself. To create a newNEXUS block, choose New NEXUS Block from the NEXUS Block submenu ofthe Edit menu. You will be presented with the NEXUS Blocks Listwindow, showing you all of the NEXUS blocks MacClade understands andhas control over (these are yellowed, and are not currently editable- this will change slightly soon), as well as the new, untitled blockyou just created. Type in the appropriate name for the block. You canenter things into the block by double-clicking on the block's numberin this list window, or by selecting the block's row and choosing"Edit NEXUS block" from the NEXUS Blocks submenu.</P><P>For example, to create a PAUP block, and enter into it aconstraint tree (say, the current tree on the screen), do thefollowing. Choose New NEXUS Block from the NEXUS Block submenu of theEdit menu, and name the new block "PAUP":</P><CENTER><IMG SRC="mc4picts/namenexusblock.gif" WIDTH=244 HEIGHT=224 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></CENTER><P>Grab the PAUP block's number and move the block so that it isimmediately after the TREES block:</P><CENTER><IMG SRC="mc4picts/movenexusblock.gif" WIDTH=244 HEIGHT=225 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></CENTER><P>Double-click on the PAUP block's number and you will be presentedwith an empty editor window:</P><CENTER><IMG SRC="mc4picts/nexusblockeditor.gif" WIDTH=597 HEIGHT=258 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></CENTER><P>You could just enter the PAUP commands at this point (DON'T enterthe two NEXUS commands that form the boundaries to the block, that isdon't enter "BEGIN PAUP;" and "END;", as these will be written intothe file automatically by MacClade). But let's ask MacClade to createa PAUP command for us, in particular the command to create aconstraint tree.
